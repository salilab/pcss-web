2012-01-03 18:18:40:	Retrieving amino acid residue sequences from ModBase for 20 provided UniProt accessions
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	Uniprot accession BARKAN was not found in ModBase
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	Validating user input to make sure that every provided peptide start location and peptide sequence matches what's in ModBase
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	The following mismatches were found between peptide sequences read from the input file and what is stored in modbase. If the phrase "[overrun - ##]" is output, it means that the specified start position, plus the length of the peptide, was greater than the length of the protein found in modbase, and thus no peptide was found at this position (here, ## is the length of the protein in ModBase, for reference)
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	Accession: Q05CV4	Start Position: 178	Input: RSRDRNRD	Modbase: [overrun -- 119]

2012-01-03 18:18:40:	None of the provided peptides for Uniprot Accession Q05CV4 in the input file was found in the specified position in ModBase.  This protein will not be considered in any analysis
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	Wrote all sequences to fasta format in file /tmp/2GQwLsTvQB/inputSequences.fasta.  Processed 18 proteins containing 24 peptides
2012-01-03 18:18:40:	1 proteins had only mismatches bewteen ModBase peptides and user-supplied peptides; these were not written
